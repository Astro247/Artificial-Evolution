# Artificial-Evolution

## ðŸ¤– What does this simulator do:  
This program, which features a graphical user interface built with Tkinter to simplify the user's experience, simulates the change in genetic code over the generations of a species.
## ðŸ§¬ How does it work: 
The program models genetic code as strings of characters, where each string represents an individualâ€™s genetic sequence, and mutations simulate genetic changes across generations, resembling the evolution of living organisms.
## ðŸ”¬ Limits of this simulator: 
The evolutionary process in the simulation is solely driven by genetic mutations (additions, deletions, and substitutions), without incorporating other evolutionary factors like natural selection or environmental influences. The emphasis is on how genetic material evolves through random changes over time.
